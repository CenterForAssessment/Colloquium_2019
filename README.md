#### Center for Assessment Colloquium

Each year, professional staff at the [Center for Assessment](http://www.nciea.org/) identify a topic which is outside of our current areas of expertise, but is likely to have a significant impact on the field and our work in the near future.  Over the course of the year, Center associates gather information on the topic, identify and interact
with experts in the field, and develop a set of critical questions to be answered. The culmination of this effort is a two-day meeting in May in which experts are convened to share information and engage in discussions with Center staff.

Educational assessment is already being enhanced by the use of analytics, machine learning, and AI (artificial intelligence).  Applications include (put “automated” in front of each of the following terms) item/dialog generation, CAT, essay scoring; assessment of difficult constructs including collaboration and leadership; showing correspondences between competencies and evidence across different contexts; development of student models; formative assessment through dialogic language and other natural and dynamic inputs; content generation; summarization of text, recommendations of instructional materials; tutoring; recommendations of course options and career pathways; data analysis for monitoring and improving programs.

CAT and essay scoring are the most developed applications of analytics and machine learning in educational assessment.  Because we had a previous Colloquium devoted to automated scoring, and a professional development workshop devoted to CAT (with Tim Davies, ETS), those two topics will not be emphasized in the 2019 Colloquium.

The Colloquium 2019 will bring together a diverse set of individuals to jointly address three main topics: 
•	How is educational assessment likely to change in the next 3-5 years, especially shaped by the affordances provided by analytics, machine learning, and AI?
•	What is necessary to make that happen?  In particular, what can states do?  What should states be aware of that others will likely do?
•	What are the current strengths and limitations?
